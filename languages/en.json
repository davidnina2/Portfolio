In this 1v1 match, players must recruit employees and use utility cards to gain an advantage over their opponent. To promote diversity, there are three available races: Goblins, Amphibians, and Ogres. Each race has its own expertise, so it's essential to create a good mix, otherwise our forge won't secure any contracts, leading to our defeat."
